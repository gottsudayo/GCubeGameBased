# GCubeGame Based Project

# Intro
This project was made as a base. It is very simple and light. But it has some problems.
It can't be launch as native application. However, I can't program with C++.
Therefore, I made it with C#.

In the future, I want to make multi player game with this project.

# How to Use
## 0. Install .NET 8.0 Runtime (unrequired)
You need to install .NET 8.0 Runtime to run this project faster.
However, if you can't install it, you can run this project with build-in edition.

## 1. Download the game
First, you need to download the game from [Releases](https://github.com/gottsudayo/GCubeGame/releases).
In step 0, if you could install .NET 8.0 Runtime, you can download **GCubeGame-UseRuntime8.zip**.
If you couldn't, you can download **GCubeGame-UnuseRuntime.zip**.
But don't download it in administrator directory.
If you did it, you can't run the game.

## 2. Play the game!
After downloading, you can play the game fastly.
Just open the folder and run **GCubeGame.exe**!
